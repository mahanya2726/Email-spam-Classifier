# Email-spam-Classifier
This repository contains a machine learning-based email spam classifier built with Streamlit, which classifies emails as either spam or not spam. The model is trained using a dataset of labeled emails, and the application uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess and classify the email content.

Features:

Input Field: Users can input the content of an email.
Spam Detection: The model predicts whether the email is spam or not spam.
Probability Visualization: Displays the probability of the email being spam or not spam through a bar graph.
Highlighted Spam Words: The application highlights the words in the email that contribute to the classification as spam.
User-friendly Interface: Developed using Streamlit for easy and interactive deployment.

Technologies Used:

1.Python
2.Streamlit
3.scikit-learn
4.NLTK
5.Machine Learning (Text Classification)
6.Natural Language Processing (NLP)

How to Use:

1.Enter the email content into the text area.
2.Click the 'Predict' button.
3.View the spam classification result along with highlighted spam-related words and probability visualization.
